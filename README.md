This project implements a digital controller for a three-floor elevator system using Verilog HDL. The design is based on a Finite State Machine (FSM) model to control elevator movement, door operations, overload detection, and safety mechanisms.

The elevator responds to floor button requests, prioritizes floor selection, ensures safe door operation, and prevents movement during overload conditions.
